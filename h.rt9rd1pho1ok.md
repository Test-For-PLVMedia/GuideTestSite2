News Package Standards
======================

\[TODO:\] Don’t be bad, make sure you would be proud of it if you showed your mother. Make it like if you were trying to win a Nobel peace prize. Be on time like if you were trying to surprise your friend for a surprise party, if you’re late you miss the important part.

Conventions for Lower Thirds
----------------------------

\[TODO:\] If they are on the left, put a lower third on the right. If they are on the right, put a lower third on the left.

Interview Best Practices
------------------------

\[TODO:\]

### Contacting your Interviewee

\[TODO:\] We won’t ever provide a “template,” but general things:

### Conduct

\[TODO:\] Always be professional and courteous. Never reciprocate rudeness to an interviewee. Remember that the way you act before, after, and during the interview is a reflection not only of you but of the entire academy. You are asking that person to do you a favor by letting you interview them so make sure you are kind and respectful. Don’t be out-classed. It sounds like very dumb when you put it like that but it is just a good general rule of thumb.

### Rule of Thirds

\[TODO:\]

### “Talking Space”

\[TODO:\] They should be talking into open space, not at the edge of the screen talking offscreen.
